This App is meant for a docker container.

### After cloning this repo:

1. Go to cloned directory, open console and type: npm install

2. Create a environment file called: "config.env" and add two variables "ATLAS_URI", "PORT". 

ATLAS_URI has the uri link of your mongodb atlas account. (e.g.) "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.<id>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

PORT can be any number you want (5000 recommended).
